------

This is a simple command-line tool to compute combinations (nCr) using iterative factorials in C.

## 💡 Features
- Accepts two integers `n` and `r` as input.
- Calculates combinations using the formula:

  \[
  nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
  \]

- Displays the result in the format `nCr = result`.

## 🛠️ Compilation & Run

```bash
gcc Combinations_Calculator.c -o comb
./comb
```
